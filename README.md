#This c program were given as TP by Mr.Amin Saiah for computer science student (2nd year) Computer Architecture
#This will gives you an idea how you can implement it , i know mine is suck but still works , so if you have any suggestions don't hesitate to contact me and give me your suggestions 




#Execution 
#if you read the program , you'll notice that it reads a file with name tp.txt , that file will contain the instructions 
#in the main function you have to give the program the exact number of instruction that you wish to execute By default it's 4 instrction even file has more !
# you have to create file tp.txt in same dir of executable in order to execute it , if not you have to change the file dir inside the program
# tp.txt will contains the follwing instructions : ADD , MOV , JMP , SUB 
#                                   registers    : R0 , R1 , R2 , R3 , R4 , PC ... You don't have right to w/r from PC
#I believe there's useless instructions so you can delete them 
# Any changes feel free to contact me to post it here for next generations
